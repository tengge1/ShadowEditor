## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>Expand to view details</summary>

1. Failed when upload models.

You need to compress the model assets into a `zip` file, and the entry file cannot be nested in a folder. The server
will decompress and put it in the `./build/public/Upload/Model` folder, and add a record in the MongoDB `_Mesh`
collection.

2. How to combine multiple models together?

Basic geometry supports multiple levels of nesting. You can add a `group` (in the geometry menu), and then drag multiple
models onto the `group` in the `Hierachy` Panel.

3. How to enable authority?

Edit `config.toml` and set `authority.enabled` to `true`. The default administrator username is `admin` and the password
is `123456`.

4. The brower
   report `asm.js has been disabled because the script debugger is connected. Please disconnect the debugger to enable asm.js.`
   Error.

**Complete error**: asm.js has been disabled because the script debugger is connected. Please disconnect the debugger to
enable asm.js. ammo.js (1,1) SCRIPT1028: SCRIPT1028: Expected identifier, string or number ShadowEditor.js (3948,8)
SCRIPT5009: 'Shadow' is not defined.

**Solution**: Tencent browser does not support `ammo.js` (WebAssembly) compiled with `Emscripten`, it is recommended to
use `Chrome` or `Firebox` instead.

5. How can I upgrade from C# to golang version?

The data structure and web client is not changed, just copy `./ShadowEditor.Web/Upload/` folder to
`build/public/Upload/`.

6. The desktop version cannot be opened.

Windows requires `Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015`. You can install
from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145  
If the desktop version cannot be opened, you can view `logs.txt`; if the port conflicts, you can modify the MongoDB and
website ports in `resources/app/config.toml`.

7. How can I create a https certificate?

Install `openssl`, and git client already contains one; Open `cmd`, `Powershell` or `shell`, and run the following
commands:

```sh
openssl genrsa -out privatekey.pem 1024
openssl req -new -key privatekey.pem -out certrequest.csr
openssl x509 -req -in certrequest.csr -signkey privatekey.pem -out certificate.pem
```

Among the generated files, `certificate.pem` is the certificate, and `privatekey.pem` is the key.
